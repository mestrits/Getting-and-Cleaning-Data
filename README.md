**Overview**

This repo is related to the final project for the above mentioned course, and a demonstration data manipulation skills learned during the course.

The data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Using this script
This R script can be used to achieve the goals outlined in the Project Instructions section below.  
However, to use this script you will need toset the path of the working directory to match the location of the source files
in your own directory.

### Project Instructions & Review Criteria
The instructions and criteria for completion of the course project.

**Instructions**
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

   1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Additional Info
Please also reference the CodeBook.MD file, for additional information about the variables, data and steps detailed in the run_analysis.R script.
